 * any lone fast-path scancode PDU because it never advertises fast-path
 * input; the native layer handles that separately with a slow-path input
 * fallback. The marker is still required to press the right key.)
 *
 * The native layer detects extended keys with `code and 0xE000 == 0xE000`
 * (ironrdp `Scancode::from_u16`) and sets KBDFLAGS_EXTENDED from it, so the
 * marker is the whole contract between these constants and the wire.
