/**
 * How the SSH-keys list on the Keys tab is ordered (#460).
 *
 * Direction is folded into the enum rather than carried as a separate flag:
 * [MANUAL] has no direction, so a `(field, descending)` pair would have an
 * unrepresentable-but-storable state, and one enum name is also the whole
 * persisted representation.
 *
 * The design question #460 raised — does sorting replace the user-defined
 * order from #238, or sit on top of it? — is answered here by making the
 * manual order the *default sort*, i.e. sorting is a view. The move-up /
 * move-down actions only appear in [MANUAL], because reordering a list
 * whose order is computed cannot show a result.
