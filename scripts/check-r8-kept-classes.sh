# Guard against the "R8 renamed a reflectively-loaded class" class of bug — the
# kind that ships a feature 100% broken in *release* builds while every *debug*
# test passes, because debug doesn't run R8. The motivating case: JavaMail's
# getStore("imaps") threw NoSuchProviderException because R8 renamed
# com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPSSLStore -> s4.c, breaking every email account in
# release builds (fixed in v5.59.45).
#
# After R8 runs on the release variant, assert that every class we load
# reflectively by fully-qualified name kept that name (identity mapping in
# mapping.txt). A renamed or removed class means a -keep rule in
# app/proguard-rules.pro is missing or broke.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-r8-kept-classes.sh [path/to/mapping.txt]
#   With no argument it auto-locates the arm64Release mapping. The standalone
#   :app:minifyArm64FullReleaseWithR8 task (what CI runs) writes to the intermediates
#   path; a full assemble also copies one to outputs/. Prefer the freshest.
