# preflight: run CI's fast `checks`-job gates locally in one command, so a
# deterministic failure (hardcoded string, stale translation export, missing
# changelog) is caught before push instead of after a ~13-min CI round-trip.
#
# Mirrors the `checks` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml exactly. It does NOT
# run lint (MissingTranslation etc. — slow, per-module) or the unit tests;
# see scripts/README or the memory note on gates. Fast: a few seconds.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/preflight.sh            # all gates (changelog gate is release-only, see below)
#   scripts/preflight.sh --no-changelog   # skip the changelog gate (WIP push, not a release)
#
# Exit non-zero if any gate fails; each prints what to do.
