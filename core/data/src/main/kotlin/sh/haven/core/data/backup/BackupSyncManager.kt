 * The interface lives in core/data so [BackupSyncManager] and the settings
 * layer depend only on it; the transport-backed implementation lives in the
 * app module (it needs `feature/sftp`'s `TransportSelector`, the same seam
 * `MailToolProvider` uses to write attachments to any connected filesystem).

/**
 * Push/pull an encrypted config backup to an existing remote (#323).
 *
 * Deliberately thin: [BackupService] already produces and consumes the
 * AES-256-GCM blob, and [RemoteBackupIo] already moves bytes to any connected
 * profile. This just composes the two. No scheduler and no conflict merge in
 * v1 — the remote copy is last-write-wins, and sync is a manual action, per
 * the shape agreed on the issue. Periodic automation can layer on later.
 *
 * The destination profile must be **connected** first (same as browsing it in
 * the Files tab): [RemoteBackupIo] resolves the live backend, opening an SFTP
 * session on demand but requiring SMB/rclone to be already connected. A
 * failure to resolve surfaces as the exception the caller maps to "connect the
 * destination first".
