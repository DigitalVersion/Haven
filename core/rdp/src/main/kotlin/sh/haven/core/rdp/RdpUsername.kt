/**
 * Split a qualified RDP username into the username and domain fields (#461).
 *
 * Windows will not auto-logon a Microsoft account unless the name is qualified
 * as `MicrosoftAccount\you@example.com`; a local account on a domain-joined box
 * often needs `.\you`. Users type those into Haven's username box because that
 * is what every guide tells them to, and Haven passed the whole string through
 * as the username with an empty domain — so Windows accepted the credentials at
 * the transport and then showed the lock screen anyway.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately narrow: **split what the user already qualified, and
 * never invent a qualification.** A bare `user@example.com` is left alone,
 * because it is indistinguishable from an Active Directory UPN — prefixing
 * `MicrosoftAccount\` on sight would log AD users out of their own domain to fix
 * a Microsoft-account case we cannot detect from the string. When someone means
 * a Microsoft account they can say so, and this makes saying so work.
 *
 * An explicit domain field always wins: if the profile already carries one, the
 * username is passed through untouched, so this can never override a choice the
 * user made deliberately.
