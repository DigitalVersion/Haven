/**
 * Where the milliseconds go when opening an SSH session (#519).
 *
 * @frebib reported connects going from under 100 ms to reliably over a second
 * on a local network. "Connect took 1.2 s" is not actionable; "resolve 980 ms,
 * handshake 90 ms" names the culprit in one line. This is the same approach that
 * settled the RDP decode (#466) and the audio pipeline (#442), where a phase
 * breakdown ended arguments that reasoning could not.
 *
 * The phases are chosen to separate causes that look identical from outside:
 *
 *  - `resolve`   — turning a hostname into an address. A `.local` name that mDNS
 *                  does not answer costs 1.5 s here before system DNS is tried,
 *                  which alone would explain the report.
 *  - `setup`     — building the JSch session: auth methods, host-CA repository,
 *                  ssh_config options. Cheap unless loading a key hits the
 *                  Android keystore, a biometric gate, or another app.
 *  - `knock`     — the port-knock hook, when one is configured.
 *  - `handshake` — JSch's own connect: TCP, key exchange and authentication.
 *                  JSch does not expose those separately, so they share a bucket.
 *
 * Deliberately free of anything identifying: phase names and durations only, so
 * it is safe in a log a user attaches to an issue (#518).
