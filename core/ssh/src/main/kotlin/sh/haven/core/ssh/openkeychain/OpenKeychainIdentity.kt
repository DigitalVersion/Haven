 * JSch [Identity] for a key held by an external provider (#487).
 *
 * The counterpart of `sh.haven.core.fido.FidoIdentity`: Haven offers the
 * public key and, when the server challenges it, hands the challenge to the
 * provider — OpenKeychain, and through it possibly a hardware token — and
 * returns whatever signature comes back. No private key passes through Haven
 * in either case.
 *
 * The provider encodes the SSH signature blob itself (algorithm name and
 * signature, RFC 4253 §6.6), which is precisely what JSch expects here, so
 * the bytes are returned untouched. This is the one place where the FIDO
 * analogy stops: an SK signature has to be assembled by hand because the
 * authenticator returns a bare signature and knows nothing about SSH.
