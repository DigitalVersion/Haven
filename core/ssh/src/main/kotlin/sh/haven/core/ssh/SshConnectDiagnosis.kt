/**
 * Name which half of an SSH connect failed, and against which address.
 *
 * JSch reports two completely different failures with messages that look alike
 * to anyone who isn't reading its source, and #557 was diagnosed wrong twice
 * because of it. Verified against com.github.mwiede:jsch 2.28.6:
 *
 * | what happened                              | message JSch produces                                  |
 * |--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
 * | TCP never completed (dropped / filtered)   | `timeout: socket is not established`                    |
 * | TCP completed, peer then said nothing      | `Session.connect: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out` |
 * | nothing listening                          | `java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused`         |
 *
 * The first comes from `Util.createSocket`, which catches the connect-phase
 * `SocketTimeoutException` and replaces it with that fixed string. The second is
 * the *read* timeout: `Session.connect` sets `SO_TIMEOUT` on an established
 * socket and then blocks for the server's identification string. So
 * **"Read timed out" is proof the TCP handshake succeeded** — something accepted
 * the connection and then stayed silent. That rules out every "the port is
 * closed" theory (a failed SPA packet, a knock that didn't land, a firewall
 * drop) and points at a middlebox, a forward aimed at the wrong backend, or a
 * filter that accepts and holds.
 *
 * None of that reached the user: the raw JSch string was surfaced verbatim, so a
 * reporter had to guess, and the address actually dialled — the resolved IP,
 * which is the one fact that separates "wrong DNS answer" from everything else —
 * appeared nowhere at all.
 *
 * Only the two timeout shapes are rewritten. `ConnectException` and
 * `UnknownHostException` already say what happened *and* carry the address on
 * Android, and #367 depends on their text; leave them be.
 *
 * The original exception is always kept as the cause, so [isSshNetworkError]'s
 * walk of the cause chain (and #376 host rediscovery with it) is unaffected.
